ProseVis has been developed in a two-stage process, first as VerseVis: Visualizing Spoken Language Features in Text by graduate students Christine Lu, Leslie Milton, and Austin Myers as part of a graduate course in visualization with Ben Shneiderman at the University of Maryland, College Park. Megan Monroe further developed the prototype as ProseVis under the auspices of this grant.
